# Fizzbuzz #
Fizzbuzz is a mathmatical challenge to create a method that will print a list of numbers. Any number that is a multiple of 3 is to be replaced by 'fizz'. Any number that is a multiple of 5 is to be replaced by 'buzz'. Any number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5 is to be replaced by 'fizzbuzz'.

## Pairing challenge ##
This fizzbuzz challenge was a part of the Makers Academy Pre-course. This was a pairing exercise between myself and Imogen Misso. This is the second iteration of this challenge as the first pairing code was deleted as per the question.
